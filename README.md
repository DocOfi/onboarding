rOpenSci Onboarding
===================

Thank you for considering submitting your package to the rOpenSci suite. In order to ensure a consistent level of software quality for our users, we ask that you go through an onboarding process so we can better understand what your software does, and how we can help improve it before adding it to our suite. This process also allows us to ensure that your package meets our [policies](https://github.com/ropensci/policies) and [guidelines](https://github.com/ropensci/packaging_guide) and provides opportunity for discussion where exceptions are requested.

## How to begin the onboarding process

* Begin by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/new).
* 
* Copy the following template into the issue and answer as concisely as possible:

```
    * Concise package description:
    * What data source(s) does it work with (if applicable)?
    * Who is the target audience?
    * Who has/will contribute to this package?
    * Are you willing to follow the rOpenSci policies (link), including transferring your repo to the rOpenSci GitHub organization account?
    * Are you willing to follow the [rOpenSci packaging guidelines](https://github.com/ropensci/packaging_guide? If you have disagreements with them, explain.
```

* Once you have completed the template, submit the issue. Someone from our team will take a look within 1-2 business days and respond with next steps.  Once your package is approved, we will provide further instructions on transferring your repository to the rOpenSci organizational account.
